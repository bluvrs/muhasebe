# Muhasebe

Small Python project. This repo is initialized with Git and a Python-friendly `.gitignore`.

## Getting Started

- Run the app: `python main.py`
- Dependencies: standard library only (update as needed)

## Notes

- Local databases (e.g., `*.db`) are ignored by Git. If you need to track one, remove it from `.gitignore`.
